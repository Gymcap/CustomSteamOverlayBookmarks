# CustomSteamOverlayBookmarks
Allows you to edit the steam overlay to add your own custom one click bookmarks in the top right list. The app also handles the files in such a way to avoid steam overwriting them or trying to download and extract a proper version each launch, as would happen modifying the overlay without this app.

To use this app properly you must copy and modify the overlaydesktop.layout in your *Steam\resource\layout\ folder. The resulting file should be named overlaydesktop.layout.Overwrite. You can find more information on editing this file here. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=643165890
