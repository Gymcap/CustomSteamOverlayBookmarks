# CustomSteamOverlayBookmarks
Allows you to edit the steam overlay to add your own custom one click bookmarks in the top right list. The app also handles the files in such a way to avoid steam overwriting them or trying to download and extract a proper version each launch, as would happen modifying the overlay without this app.
